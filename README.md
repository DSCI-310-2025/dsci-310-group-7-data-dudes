<br><br>

## Summary:
Our dataset, obtained from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/college-students-arent-the-only-ones-abusing-adderall/), contains the results of a nationwide survey that collected information about drug use and health. We will use this data to observe whether use of soft drugs (eg: alcohol and marijuana) in adolescence (ages 12-19) can predict frequency of hard drug use (eg: cocaine, heroin, meth) in early adulthood (ages 20-29).
