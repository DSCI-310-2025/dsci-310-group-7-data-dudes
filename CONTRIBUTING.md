This is a good way to check you have everything you need properly installed.

## Style Guide

* **Code:**
  * Any R code should follow the (tidyverse style guide)<https://style.tidyverse.org/>

* **Naming Conventions:**
  * Variable names are a balance of short and interpretable, each new word is separated by `_`. For example: `alcohol_use`.

* **Git Commits:**
  * Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
  * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
  * Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured descriptions.

* **Documentation:** 
  * Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

* **Packages:** 
  * Try to limit the use of new packages. 
  * If you do end up using a new package, make sure to update the `renv.lock` snapshot and also the `README.md` file.
